**Future Work**

Several promising directions could enhance the project in the future. One potential area for 
improvement is Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), which could capture sentiment 
at a more granular level, which enables the separation of opinions on specific aspects, such 
as flight comfort versus food quality. This would provide deeper insights into customer 
experiences and improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. Another direction to explore 
is the extension of the system to support multilingual reviews. By incorporating multiple 
languages, the model would be able to handle a broader range of global datasets, making 
it more versatile and accessible to users from different linguistic backgrounds. Additionally, 
deploying the model as a web app could significantly enhance its usability. Integrating the 
system into a web-based dashboard using tools such as Streamlit or Dash would allow for 
real-time input and interactive visualizations, offering a more engaging and user-friendly 
experience. Finally, incorporating real-time sentiment tracking is another avenue to 
consider. By integrating live review feeds from platforms like Twitter or TripAdvisor, the 
system could transform into a real-time monitoring tool that provides instant insights into 
customer feedback and enabling businesses to respond more proactively to customer 
concerns. These directions hold significant potential to further develop the system and 
broaden its scope.
